# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working in this repo. Read this first, then `PLAN.md`.

## What this is

`coxeter-viz` (name TBD) turns **abstract Coxeter data** — generators and the
orders of pairwise products — into geometric realizations of the group in the
three constant-curvature geometries (S/E/H, dimensions 2 & 3), and everything
downstream: tessellations, Cayley graphs, word-list images, hulls,
areas/volumes, rendered through swappable coordinate models. TypeScript +
Vite, with our own linear algebra in the core (three.js appears only in
demos and the future 3D render layer — enforced by a test); a thin Python
package drives it through a pure group-theoretic seam.

The user is a mathematician (professor). Correctness and clean,
close-to-the-math abstractions matter more than feature count.

## Status (2026-07-10 — CURRENT STATE; the full increment-by-increment history lives in PLAN.md §5)

**The 2D program is COMPLETE and instrument-grade. Milestones 1 and 3 are
closed. Milestone 4 — THE PRODUCT LAYER — is PLANNED and SIGNED OFF
(2026-07-10, PLAN.md §7): the Coxeter-matrix inference layer, the figure
document (schema v0.1), `render(container, figure)`, SVG/PNG/HTML exports,
the Vite bundle, and the Python package (Plotly pattern; `coxeter-viz` /
`coxeter_viz`), in increments P0–P9. 2D only — 3D waits until the 2D
product story is done (user ruling). Next work item: P0 (the schema/app
READMEs as specs), fresh session. Still also pending: the user's hands-on
pass of §5.7/§5.8; GPU-globe v1 stays parked.**

What exists, layer by layer (each folder README is its spec; PLAN § given):
- **math / geometry / models / polytope / coxeter** — the substrate: own
  linear algebra (flat Float64Array), the six S/E/H cells behind one
  `Geometry<P,I>`, covector walls, straight+conformal charts, the polytope
  engine, `validatePolygon` + the κ-Porti solver realizing every compact 2D
  Coxeter polygon (`RealizedPolygon`). PLAN §5.1–5.2.
- **group** (§5.4, §5.5, §5.7) — generic orbit BFS (optional `admit` prune),
  `CoxeterGroup` (tessellate, METRIC balls `orbitBall`/`tessellateBall`,
  `chamberDiameter`, `cayleyGraph`, `subgroup`), word lists
  (`elements`/`tilesFor`/`cosetIndex`/hulls), `wythoff.ts` (uniform tilings:
  ringed seed by the 3×3 solve, faces = dihedral orbits hulled).
- **viz2d/render** (§5.3.1 V0–V3+P, §5.6 T3; §5.9 split the 781-line
  `scene.ts` into `style`/`cull`/`wallclip`/`dash`/`honesty`/`item` + the
  builder) — scene → PathList → Canvas painter
  + `svg.ts` + `png.ts` (`RasterLayer` k× compositor: scale the CAMERA, so
  k× re-renders, never upsamples); intrinsic-width strokes, dashes, joins,
  domain items, fill honesty, pre-cull; interaction (zoom/pan/double-bisector
  drag/hitTest).
- **viz2d/sphere** (§5.3.2) — the perspective-globe instrument, CPU only
  (drag/zoom/SVG/dashed hidden lines). No GPU path (see the 2026-07-06
  globe discussion in the session record / parked list below).
- **viz2d/shader** (§5.6, §5.8) — the GPU field: per-pixel folding
  `p ← p − 2⟨p,c⟩·Jc` in canonical coordinates (κ-branch-free, n-gon
  MAX_WALLS 16), all five flat charts, parity/edge/vertex layers, plus the
  FIELD PROGRAMS: `coset` (M⁻¹-accumulated anchor image hashed by the
  SHARED `hashHue` — CPU/SVG/GPU hues agree bit-exactly), `star` (Cayley /
  uniform edge nets), `regions` (Wythoff face types); and the VECTOR TWIN
  for SVG (`fieldScene` + ADAPTIVE `coverageRadius` — intrinsic-radius
  coverage from ε px, no per-group depth constants — + `mergeFieldPaths`).
- **viz2d/kit** (§5.9) — the picturing toolkit (NO math): `realize`
  (spec→group→model), `scene` (item builders + the `tile:`/`cay:`/`wall:` id
  scheme + parity/coset/hue color maps), `camera` (fit + tipped view),
  `field` (`fieldStyle` + coset/star/regions assembly), `palette`. All viz
  math lives here or in the library core (`Hyperplane.foot`, `cayleyBall`,
  `dihedralWords`/`parabolicFixedPoint`/`parseWord*`).
- **demos/shared** (§5.9) — the demo harness (composable primitives, no
  mount-functions): `pageShell`/`canvas2d`/`layerStack`/`sizeStack`/
  `rafScheduler`/`button`/`checkbox`/`textInput`/`kSelect`/`downloadBlob`/
  `downloadSvg`/`exportSizeLabel`. Every 2D demo reads *data → scene → mount*.

Demos (`npm run dev <name>`): `group` (Milestone 1), `wordlists` (M3),
`wordfile` (M3.5 + GPU field + exports), `tilingshader` (the field
instrument + CPU-overlay verifier), `tilings` (any polygon; fd always
orange, word list red on top; cayley checkbox), `cosets` (parabolic coset
field), `uniform` (Wythoff rings), `render2d`/`sphereview` (system demos),
`hello` (throwaway).

**Pending the user's hands-on pass**: §5.7 (cosets / tilings-cayley /
uniform) and §5.8 (field programs). Queued aesthetic rulings: the fd tile
dims the central Cayley star (identity-knife layering); coset/uniform
palettes.

**Parked / deferred** (with provenance): GPU globe v1 (scoped 2026-07-06:
both sheets + tint in one pass, occlusion approximation documented,
PNG-only — build only if needed for figures; the globe SVG twin is
explicitly REFUSED for now); promote the many-times-duplicated group→Scene
demo conversion to an adapter module (available whenever); a polygon
class/type (deferred until non-convex regions become first-class); the
Tits/ShortLex automaton and the spherical hull policy (PLAN §6).

Working facts: 428 tests / 17 files, strict typecheck; the house
verification pattern is exact spherical pins (orders, Euler counts) +
headless-Chrome pixel-coincidence screenshots; `shader.glsl` at the repo
root is the user's untracked reference shader (nothing survives verbatim).

`PLAN.md` is the working plan, edited collaboratively. In place: the
toolchain (see Commands) and the geometry substrate — `src/math/` (the
linear layer: `Vec`/`Covec` with the two matrix actions `applyToVector` /
`applyToCovector`, flat row-major matrices; plus the Jacobi
eigensolver, linear solve), `src/geometry/` (the six cells S/E/H × 2D/3D
behind one `Geometry<P,I>`, walls as covectors with the uniform reflection
I − 2(Jc)cᵀ), `src/models/` (straight + conformal charts per geometry,
Globe2), and `src/polytope/` (fromHalfspaces/fromVertices in all six cells
via the J-free cross-product vertex solve; contravariant wall transport;
the spherical hemisphere refusal), and `src/coxeter/` (the RealizationSpec
seam: `validatePolygon` with exact classification, and the κ-Porti
inscribed-circle solver realizing every compact 2D Coxeter polygon in
S/E/H with verified postconditions) — each folder specified by its README.
`demos/hello` and
`tests/smoke.test.ts` are Phase 0 throwaways, replaced when real work lands.
The parent systems being married (and cleaned up) in this rewrite:

- `/Users/strettel/Code/homogeneous-spaces` — geometry substrate (S/E/H
  geometries, models, metric-correct rendering)
- `/Users/strettel/Code/hyperbolic-polytopes` — Coxeter machinery (polytope
  engine, solvers, groups, Cayley); also holds `coxeter-viz-DESIGN.md` (the
  original product design) and `COX_COMPUTE/` (the seedless 3D solver
  pipeline, after Roeder)

## Commands

- `npm run dev <demo>` — run a demo (Vite; one server per demo, ports 5173+).
  Demos live in `demos/<name>/main.ts`; pages are synthesized (no index.html
  files on disk); the dev-server root `/` lists all demos.
- `npm run build <demo>` / `npm run preview <demo>` — build into `dist/<demo>`.
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` (strict).
- `npm run test` / `npm run test:watch` — vitest (`tests/*.test.ts`).

## Working norms

- **A rigorous written plan precedes ANY code, every time.** Plan approval is
  not license to build a whole phase in one burst: execute in small
  reviewable increments, surface every interpretation of an ambiguous answer
  before acting on it, and pause at checkpoints. The user runs one work item
  per fresh session, inheriting the agreed plan via this file and PLAN.md.
- **Plan collaboratively.** Discuss before building; treat vision/context
  messages as read-and-absorb, not build triggers. Do not scaffold, create
  files, or "get ahead" without explicit agreement.
- **Verify geometry claims** with throwaway `node` scripts / vitest before
  asserting them.
- Copy nothing verbatim from the parents — re-derive (see PLAN.md §3, Rules
  of construction). Parents are references, not sources.
- Every `src/` folder gets a `README.md` stating its mathematics, written
  first as the module's spec.
- Dependency direction is law:
  math → geometry → models → polytope → coxeter → group → {2D viz | 3D viz} → app.
  The two visualization systems are TOTALLY SEPARATE: 2D lives under
  `src/viz2d/` — `render/` (the flat-chart core + shared seams), `sphere/`
  (the perspective globe), `shader/` (the GPU field), and `kit/` (the
  picturing toolkit: group data → `Scene`/`Camera`/`TilingStyle`, no math) —
  and has no three.js; 3D (not yet built) will be built on three.js and gets
  its own plan before any code. **All viz math lives in the library core or
  `kit/`; the demos (`demos/*` + the `demos/shared` harness) are thin —
  data → scene → mount, no math inline.** The consolidation reorg is
  PLAN.md §5.9 (renamed render2d→viz2d/render, sphereview→viz2d/sphere,
  tilingshader→viz2d/shader; historical §5.3.1 etc. labels keep the old
  names).
- Don't create branches or commit unless asked. Commit messages end with the
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude` line.

## Glossary (one vocabulary, used identically everywhere)

| term | meaning |
|---|---|
| **Coxeter matrix** | symmetric integer M, M_ii = 1, M_ij = order of s_i s_j (−1 sentinel for ∞). The *group*. The public input form. |
| **Gram matrix** | ⟨n_i, n_j⟩ of realized walls. A *byproduct* of realization; an input only internally, for simplices. |
| **wall / mirror** | the fixed hyperplane of a generating reflection; stored as a **covector** n, incidence via the pairing ⟨p, n⟩ |
| **pole** | the ambient vector representing a wall (spacelike unit in H, etc.) |
| **chamber / fundamental domain (FD)** | the intersection of the walls' half-spaces; the tile carried around by the group |
| **decoration** | data on a meeting wall-pair: `{ walls: [i,j], order: m }` ⇒ dihedral angle π/m |
| **undecorated pair** | walls that do NOT meet in the realized polytope; their distance is moduli the solver resolves canonically |
| **canonical representative** | where moduli exist, the chamber with an inscribed circle/sphere (= minimal perimeter; Porti in H²; the square in E²) |
| **RealizationSpec ("spec")** | the internal seam: geometry + dim + FD combinatorics + decorations. Exact side above, numeric side below. |
| **realization** | a solver's output: walls (covectors), interior point, diagnostics; provably realizes the spec's combinatorics |
| **straight(-geodesic) chart** | the model where geodesics are straight lines (Klein in H, gnomonic in S, the plane itself in E); all hulls/combinatorics are computed there |
| **generator indexing** | wall index = generator index everywhere (combinatorics, decorations, words, Cayley); load-bearing, never cosmetic |
| **word** | list of generator indices `[i₀,…,i_k]`, applied left to right (i₀ first) ⇒ element R_{i_k}···R_{i₀} |

## Conventions (inherited from the parents, to be kept)

- Strict TS (`noUnusedLocals/Parameters`, `erasableSyntaxOnly` → no parameter
  properties / enums), Vite, vitest, `npm run dev <demo>` with
  `demos/<name>/main.ts` and a synthesized HTML page.
- Generic over the canonical point type `P` (Vector3 in 2D ambient R³,
  Vector4 in 3D ambient R⁴) and isometry type `I`; never branch on
  geometry/dimension except where genuinely necessary — and prefer
  capability-style dispatch over `kind` switches.
- After any change: `npm run typecheck && npm run test`.
